# House Price Prediction

Built a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features like location, area, number of rooms, and amenities.

# Problem Statement
Accurate house price prediction helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions using historical housing data.

# Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask

# Regression Pipeline
- Performed data cleaning (handled missing values and outliers)
- Applied feature selection to improve model performance
- Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest models
- Compared models to handle linear and non-linear patterns
- Evaluated performance using R² score

# Results
- Achieved *~85% R² score*, indicating strong prediction accuracy on test data
